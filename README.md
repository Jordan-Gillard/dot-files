# Jordan's Dot Files
This repository is used to store my dot files. These files contain 
configurations and custom functions, and not private stuff like API keys.

### Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you can simplify a shell script, then by all
means, feel free to leave these files cleaner than you found them. It is
definitely appreciated.
